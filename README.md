# Waayu-AndroidApp
Waayu is an Android app that connects with a smartwatch to monitor users' real-time health metrics. These metrics are sent to a machine learning model via API, which analyzes them for abnormalities. If any issues are detected, the app provides yoga asanas and remedies for minor issues, and locates the nearest hospital and connects the user with a doctor for serious issues. Additionally, Waayu features games, a news section, and an underdevelopment Ayurvedic shopping mart.
